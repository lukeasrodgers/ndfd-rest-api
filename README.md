# NdfdRestApi

Ruby gem to interact with the NOAA's NDFD REST web service (http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/rest.php).

Not stable, not ready for production use.

# Credits

Inspired by https://github.com/outoftime/noaa, which does not appear to
be actively maintained, and was built for an older NOAA service.
